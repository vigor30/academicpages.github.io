Tax evasion is an highly undesirable phenomenon as it demonstrates the inability of the State to ensure an equal individual contribution to the needs of society. International literature has long been interested in the phenomenon, searching for individual and social motivations, in order to establish the most appropriate policy strategies for control and recovery. We have based our work on the latest generation of tax compliance models, using a utility function for taxpayers that take into account the psychological components of the taxpayer's behaviour and imperfect information, as well as the role of the environment in which the taxpayer operates. Therefore underlining the importance of psychological factors, social norms and tax morale, and, more generally, of institutional quality.
Using a comprehensive database, which collects information on the payment of car ownership tax, we have analysed the adaptation of the most recent models of evasion studies to the behaviours detected. The results of the work show that evasion poses an equity problem, since the propensity to evade is not the same for everyone, but is greater among some categories of individuals with a low aversion to risk. Friendly warning policy results only marginally effective but can improve if properly designed; while awareness of the good use of resources can increase the willingness to contribute through the payment of taxes; moreover evasion is a social rather than individual phenomenon, to be fought primarily through the strengthening of civic awareness and institutional and political quality. In this context, the stigmatisation of evasive behaviour is a fundamental aspect.
