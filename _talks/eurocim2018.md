The creation of urban rail transport infrastructure may have general implications on the
economic landscape of the peripheral city areas that are served. Our motivating application focuses on the causal effects of a tramway line built in Florence (Italy) on a number
of outcomes related to the local commercial vitality and on the economic performance of
the area retailers. It considers a time horizon that encompasses both the construction
and the later period of operation of the infrastructure. In theory, the streets where the
tramway is built might suffer from harder accessibility and poor attractiveness during
construction works, whereas alternative streets in the same neighborhood where traffic
is diverted might benefit from the ongoing works. More ambiguously, when the infrastructure is ready, the new tramway line might: i) have beneficial effects on both the
streets it serves and the neighboring ones due to improved area accessibility and attractiveness; ii) have beneficial effects on the streets it serves and harmful (crowd out) effects
on alternative streets in the neighborhood; iii) crowd out shops in the neighborhood in
favor of those located in distant areas that are made more accessible by the tramway.
This kind of observational setting poses interesting challenges for causal inference, as
it clearly requires to allow for possible interference between streets. To conduct our
analysis at the street level, we adopt the potential outcomes framework and provide an
original extension of the synthetic control group approach to a setting where betweenstreet interference is possible. Exploiting information from multiple control streets that,
because of their distance from the tramway, may, or may not, interfere with the streets
under treatment, we disentangle the direct and the spillover-mediated effects of the
tramway in a nonparametric fashion.
