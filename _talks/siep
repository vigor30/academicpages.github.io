The study of the taxpayers’ behavior appears to be a topic of great
relevance and interest.
In this work we have tried to explain the taxpayers' compliancy towards the
vehicle property tax in Tuscany, using a large dataset on tax paid by vehicle
owners in 2014. In particular, vehicle property tax, has a role in regional
economy and fiscal policy.
Aims of our work
• Estimate the determinants of taxpayers’ behaviour
• Focus and distinguish between individuals determinants and environment
determinants
• Exploit the role of risk adversion and tax morale in our empirical
application
